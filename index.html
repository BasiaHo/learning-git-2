        <h1><i>Title: The Flea</i></h1>

        <p>Marke but this flea, and marke in this,<br>
            How little that which thou deny'st me is;<br>
            It suck'd me first, and now sucks thee,<br>
            And in this flea, our two bloods mingled bee;<br>
            Thou know'st that this cannot be said<br>
            A sinne, nor shame, nor losse of maidenhead,<br>
            Yet this enjoyes before it wooe,<br>
            And this, alas, is more than wee would doe.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Oh stay, three lives in one flea spare,<br>
            Where wee almost, yea more then maryed are,<br>
            This flea is you and I, and this <br>
            Our marriage bed, and mariage temple is; <br>
            Though parents grudge, and you, w'are met, <br>
            And cloystered in these living walls of Jet. <br>
            Though use make you apt to kill mee, <br>
            Let not to that, selfe murder added bee, <br>
            And sacrilege, three sinnes in killing three. <br>
        </p>

        <p>Cruell and sodaine, hast thou since <br>
            Purpled thy naile, in blood if innocence? <br>
            Wherein could this flea guilty bee, <br>
            Except in that drow which it suckt from thee? <br>
            Yet thou triumph'st, and saist that thou <br>
            Find'st not thy selfe, nor mee the weaker now; <br>
            'Tis true, then learne how false, feares bee; <br>
            Just so much honor, when thou yeeld'st to mee, <br>
            Will wast, as this flea's death tooke life from thee. <br>
        </p>
